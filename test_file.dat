Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence

Objective
To understand the limitations of communicating with extra-terrestrial intelligence, and the methods with which we could attempt to do this.

Introduction
Any attempt to communicate with extra-terrestrial intelligence would involve emitting some signal into space, which would contain information that we hope alien civilizations could decode. Since these signals can travel no faster than light, the speed of light is the most obvious constraints on interstellar communication. The speed of light is a universal constant, and can be measured using the basic physics formula, speed = frequency x wavelength.

Any signal that is broadcasted with information, whether it be on Earth or into space, must be encoded in some way, so that it can be interpreted correctly by whoever receives it. Two common ways to do this are amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). 

Using techniques known as the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform, most signals can be interpreted as a collection of complex sinusoids, each of which oscillates at a particular frequency. Often, the frequencies at which someone wants to broadcast a signal are not the same as the actual frequencies that make up the signal; for example, a radio station may want to broadcast their signals at 102.3 megahertz, but the actual signal that is created by their music only consists of frequencies between 0 and 20 kilohertz. This is what led to the development of amplitude modulation. Essentially, due to properties of the Fourier transform, multiplying a signal by a cosine function will actually shift the component frequencies of the signal, and the size of the shift is proportional to the fundamental frequency of the cosine function. Using this knowledge, devices can be built that take a signal and shift its component frequencies, so that the signal can then be broadcast at the desired frequency range. Similar properties of the Fourier transform allow receivers to be built which recover the original signal, based on the broadcasted one. This is the theory that AM radio was created around. The name “amplitude modulation” is due to the fact that multiplying the original signal by a cosine function results in a signal with a constantly oscillating (“modulating”) magnitude (“amplitude”).
Frequency modulation is a another technique for encoding information in a broadcasted signal. Frequency modulation is more sophisticated than amplitude modulation (and is not covered in ELEC 260!), but essentially it modifies the broadcasted signal in such a way that the component frequencies of the signal change with respect to time.

The Arecibo message was a radio message sent into space in 1974, using frequency modulation. It consisted of a string of bits that was meant to contain basic information about the human race, so that an extra-terrestrial astronomer could hypothetically detect it and interpret it. While unlikely that this message will actually ever reach another civilization, the real purpose of this message was to provide inspiration and excitement towards astronomy among the general population.

Another factor that limits us in our search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is the lifetime of intelligent civilizations. We consider Earth to be a home for intelligent life, but if another life form observed the Earth even just a few hundred years ago, there would be little evidence of advanced civilizations. In fact, of the 4.5 billion years that the Earth has existed, the technology required to receive or send radio signals has only existed for around 50 years; in other words, “advanced” civilizations capable of communicating with life in outer space have only existed on Earth for 0.00000001% of the planet’s lifetime. Assuming this trend holds true throughout the universe, even if we were to observe a planet that could sustain/has sustained intelligent life, there is a good chance that we are too early or too late to communicate with it.

To come up with an approximation of the length of time that the average intelligent civilization might exist, we consider some likely ways that a civilization might be wiped out: asteroid or comet impacts. By using data collected from Earth, we can develop estimates of the amount of time that passes between exterminating impacts, and apply these results to our estimates of the abundance of current extra-terrestrial life in our universe.

The Drake equation, developed by Frank Drake, is an equation that attempts to estimate the number of extra-terrestrial civilizations we should expect to exist in the galaxy at any given time. It is really just an outline of the most important factors that should be considered when trying to approximate this number.






Procedure
This lab was completed in the following steps. All data and calculations are included on the Data/Observations/Calculations page.
Sebastien (the lab instructor) introduced the concepts behind the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, including some history of the search, the methods for measuring the speed of light, and the basics of amplitude modulation and frequency modulation.
To (crudely) measure the speed of light, chocolate was grated onto a paper plate, and the plate was microwaved for 20 seconds. The plate was then removed, and the resulting pattern of melted/non-melted chocolate was used to determine the wavelength of the microwaves. The pattern showed three spots where chocolate had not been melted by the microwave, indicating the presence of a node at these places. The distance between each of these spots was measured, giving an approximation of the wavelength of the microwave. Using this measurement along with the known frequency of the microwave, it was possible to approximate the speed of the microwaves (and thus, of light).
Sebastien then talked briefly about the Arecibo message, and after determining the two primes that produce 1679 (the number of bits in the message), the students used the SuperMongo plotting software to display the Arecibo message. The students also attempted to interpret the message’s meaning (fairly unsuccessfully) before it was explained by Sebastien.
Next, Sebastien explained the significance of the Drake equation, and the current estimates we have for some of the values.
Finally, the students used the impact simulator to obtain some information about large impacts and their frequency, and used these results to come up with an approximation for the result of the Drake equation.

Discussion
The first part of the lab involved estimating the speed of light, based on the frequency and wavelength of the waves emitted by a microwave. The calculations for this part are included on the Data/Observations/Calculations page. This was obviously a fairly imprecise measurement, as the distance between the unmelted portions was just estimated with a ruler and there could have been other factors that affected the positions of the unmelted regions. However, our measured value of 2.695x108 m/s was fairly close to the known value of 2.998x108 m/s. 

Using the known speed of light, the distance that the Arecibo message has travelled at this point is roughly 3.9x1014 km (or 41 light years, of course!). While this may seem far, the object that the message was broadcasted towards, globular cluster M13, is some 25000 light years away!

The Arecibo message consisted of 1679 bits, which is a semiprime number (the product of two primes). The primes that produce 1679 were found to be 23 and 73. Using the SuperMongo software, it was clear that the bits were to be viewed as a 23 by 73 rectangle, with 23 being the width. If an alien were to detect this message, I think that it is unlikely that they would immediately see it as a message; if it were received on Earth, scientists would certainly view it with some skepticism. However, assuming alien scientists are at least as intelligent as NASA scientists here on Earth, I think it is plausible that if it were to be seen as a message, the various parts of the message could be correctly interpreted. It does, however, seem particularly unlikely that this signal actually reach an alien FM radio receiver, without having been distorted during its 25000 years of travel.

Upon quick investigation of the message, the only feature that is obvious is the human being in the middle. The rest are very cryptic, although careful thought could eventually unveil most of them. The binary numbers at the top of the page and the solar system representation near the bottom are the two that I would expect would be the next easiest to interpret, although they were explained before I could recognize them myself.

The final section of the lab, analyzing the frequency and effect of giant impacts, involved a couple pages of calculations and data that are included on the Data/Observations/Calculations page. These calculations show that major comet showers, caused by close encounter between stars, occur on the order of once every million years, while the the creation of asteroid families is about a hundred times more rare. These estimates provide a ballpark upper limit for the length of time a civilization can survive, before being annihilated by a large impact.

Using the impact simulator, it was found that even relatively small objects could have devastating effects if they were to collide with the Earth. For example, the simulator claimed that a 1 kilometer diameter asteroid landing 100 kilometers off the coast of Vancouver Island would cause spontaneous ignition of clothing and vegetation in Victoria, and would likely cause the collapse of small bridges and multistory buildings. In fact, a lump of iron just 200 meters across could generate more destructive energy than all of the nuclear devices tested in 1996 combined. The Iturralde Crater in Bolivia is 8 km wide, which according to the impact simulator would have been caused by an asteroid roughly 400 m in diameter. Luckily, the frequency of impacts of this size is around one every 125000 years, so we are not yet due for another impact of this size.

Using the estimated timescales of comet showers and asteroid impacts in the Drake equation, we estimated that the Kepler telescope may have viewed between 5 and 300 intelligent civilizations, depending on whether we used the comet shower timescale or the asteroid impact timescale. Of course, this number involved a lot of guesswork; however, it is a good place to start, and provides at least a reasonable argument that intelligent civilizations are abundant in our galaxy and universe.
